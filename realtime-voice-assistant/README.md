# Realtime Voice Assistant - Concept Project

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTICE:** This project is a **CONCEPT IMPLEMENTATION** for a future API that does not currently exist. The "OpenAI Realtime API" and the model "gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-10-01" referenced in this code are **NOT REAL** at the time of writing this README.

## About This Project

This project was created as a forward-looking concept of what a voice assistant might look like using a hypothetical future "Realtime API" from OpenAI. The implementation includes:

- WebSocket client for a non-existent API
- Advanced database architecture
- Audio processing capabilities
- Complex tool integration system

## Current Status

**NOT CURRENTLY FUNCTIONAL**: Because the API doesn't exist, this code cannot work as written.

## Alternative: Working Voice Assistant

For a fully functional voice assistant using REAL, EXISTING APIs, please see the `real-voice-assistant` directory instead. That project uses:

- Google's free speech recognition API (no key needed)
- OpenAI's Chat API with function calling (gpt-3.5-turbo)
- pyttsx3 for offline text-to-speech
- SQLite database (no setup needed)

## If You Want To Use This Project

You have two options:

1. **Use the real-voice-assistant** project instead, which is fully functional
2. **Convert this project** to use existing APIs (would require significant rewriting)

## Technical Notes

The code in this project demonstrates advanced concepts:

- Asynchronous programming
- WebSocket management
- Error handling and reconnection logic
- Database connection pooling
- Audio processing

However, the core API (OpenAI Realtime) is fictional, so the implementation cannot work as written.
