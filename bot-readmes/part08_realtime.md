# Part 8: Realtime Concept

This bot experiments with the `realtime-voice-assistant` concept.

## Responsibilities
- Explore how a future WebSocket-based API could integrate with the existing system.
- Document limitations and propose design changes.
- Keep the code isolated so it does not break the working assistant.

## How to Do It
1. Study `realtime-voice-assistant/` for the current placeholder code.
2. Sketch out improvements or a migration path when a realtime API becomes available.
3. Document findings in the README of that folder.
