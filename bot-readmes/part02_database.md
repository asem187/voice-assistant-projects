# Part 2: Database and Memory System

This bot manages all persistent storage.

## Responsibilities
- Implement and maintain the SQLite database in `real-voice-assistant/database.py`.
- Ensure the schema supports task tracking and general memories.
- Provide functions to create, list, update, and delete tasks.
- Keep the code formatted with Black and flake8 clean.

## How to Do It
1. Review `database.py` for existing functions.
2. Add any additional helper methods as needed.
3. Run unit tests (if available) or simple scripts to verify database operations.
4. Format changes with:
   ```bash
   black real-voice-assistant/database.py
   flake8 real-voice-assistant/database.py
   ```
