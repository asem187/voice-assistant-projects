# Part 10: Packaging and Deployment

This bot prepares the project for release.

## Responsibilities
- Create a setup script or Dockerfile for easy installation.
- Document how to start each component in production mode.
- Provide instructions for deploying the web dashboard to a server.

## How to Do It
1. Review `setup.py` in `real-voice-assistant` for reference.
2. Consider adding a `Dockerfile` that runs the assistant and dashboard.
3. Write deployment steps in this README so others can reproduce them.
