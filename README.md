# Voice Assistant Projects

This repository contains two voice assistant implementations plus a new web dashboard for task tracking:

1. **`real-voice-assistant/`** - A fully functional voice assistant using real APIs
2. **`realtime-voice-assistant/`** - A concept implementation for future OpenAI Realtime API
3. **`assistant-dashboard/`** - Flask web dashboard with task tracker
   (uses the same SQLite database as the voice assistant)

## 🚀 Quick Start - Working Voice Assistant

If you want a voice assistant that **works right now**, use the `real-voice-assistant/` project:

```bash
cd real-voice-assistant/
python setup.py
# Edit .env file with your OpenAI API key
python main.py
```

## 🚀 Quick Start - Web Dashboard

```bash
cd assistant-dashboard/
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py  # uses the shared voice_assistant.db
```

The dashboard lets you add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them using a simple Bootstrap interface.

## 🎯 real-voice-assistant/

### What It Does
- **Listens** to your voice using Whisper (local speech-to-text)
- **Thinks** using OpenAI's real Chat API (gpt-3.5-turbo)
- **Remembers** things you tell it in a SQLite database
- **Speaks** back to you using ElevenLabs text-to-speech
- **Creates tasks** and tracks them persistently

### Features
- ✅ Real-time voice interaction
- ✅ Persistent memory system
- ✅ Task management
- ✅ Function calling capabilities
- ✅ Works offline (except AI processing)
- ✅ No complex setup required

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Microphone and speakers

### Example Interactions
- "Remember that my favorite color is blue"
- "What's my favorite color?"
- "Create a task to buy groceries"
- "Show me my tasks"
- "What time is it?"

## 🔮 realtime-voice-assistant/

### What It Would Do (If It Worked)
- **Real-time bidirectional voice communication** via WebSockets
- **Advanced audio processing** with librosa and numpy
- **Enterprise-grade architecture** with PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery
- **FastAPI web interface** with authentication
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with Prometheus metrics
- **Scalable microservices** design

### Why It Doesn't Work
This project was built for OpenAI's "Realtime API" which **doesn't exist yet**. The implementation is a forward-looking concept of what such a system might look like.

### Technical Highlights
- Asynchronous WebSocket management
- Database connection pooling
- Advanced error handling and reconnection logic
- Audio processing and streaming
- JWT authentication
- Structured logging
- Health checks and metrics

## 🛠️ Installation

### For the Working Version (real-voice-assistant)

```bash
cd real-voice-assistant/
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
python main.py
```

### For the Concept Version (realtime-voice-assistant)

```bash
cd realtime-voice-assistant/
pip install -r requirements.txt
# This won't work until OpenAI releases a Realtime API
```

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### real-voice-assistant
- **Speech Recognition**: FREE (Whisper open-source)
- **Text-to-Speech**: ElevenLabs pricing (fallback to free pyttsx3)
- **Database**: FREE (SQLite)
- **AI Processing**: ~$0.002 per conversation (OpenAI API)

### realtime-voice-assistant
- **Would depend on OpenAI's future Realtime API pricing**
- **Additional costs for PostgreSQL, Redis if using cloud services**

## 🤝 Contributing

## 🎬 Demo

### Working Demo (real-voice-assistant)
1. Run `python main.py`
2. Say "Remember my name is John"
3. Say "What's my name?"
4. Say "Create a task to call mom"
5. Say "Show me my tasks"

### Concept Demo (realtime-voice-assistant)
- Currently not functional due to fictional API dependency
- Would provide real-time voice streaming when API becomes available

## 🚦 Status

- **real-voice-assistant**: ✅ Production Ready
- **realtime-voice-assistant**: 🚧 Waiting for OpenAI Realtime API

## 📞 Support

If you have issues with:
- **real-voice-assistant**: Check the README, it should work out of the box
- **realtime-voice-assistant**: This is expected to not work until OpenAI releases the Realtime API

## 🔮 Future Plans

1. **When OpenAI releases Realtime API**: Update the concept project to work
2. **Enhanced real-voice-assistant**: Add more features while keeping it simple
3. **Hybrid approach**: Combine the simplicity of the working version with advanced features

## 🤖 Bot Task Breakdown

The `bot-readmes/` directory divides this repository into ten focused parts. Assign each bot a file and follow the instructions inside:

1. **part01_setup.md** – environment setup and dependency installation
2. **part02_database.md** – database and memory system
3. **part03_stt.md** – speech recognition with Whisper
4. **part04_tts.md** – text-to-speech via ElevenLabs
5. **part05_openai.md** – OpenAI API integration and tools
6. **part06_cli.md** – command-line interface
7. **part07_dashboard.md** – web dashboard and GUI
8. **part08_realtime.md** – realtime concept exploration
9. **part09_testing.md** – testing and quality assurance
10. **part10_deploy.md** – packaging and deployment

Each README explains the tasks and how to complete them. When every bot finishes its part, combine the results to build the full application.

## \U0001F90D Branch Setup for Bots

Run `init_bot_branches.sh` once after cloning the repository to create a Git branch for each bot task:

```bash
bash init_bot_branches.sh
```

The script makes the following branches locally:

- `part01_setup`
- `part02_database`
- `part03_stt`
- `part04_tts`
- `part05_openai`
- `part06_cli`
- `part07_dashboard`
- `part08_realtime`
- `part09_testing`
- `part10_deploy`

Switch branches with `git checkout <branch-name>` and push them to your remote to share progress. Merge each branch into `main` when its tasks are complete.
